/**
 * Reset the PHP-Fpm opcache under Quibble environment
 *
 * In the CI environment, PHP Fpm is never revalidating files once they have
 * entered the opcache (`opcache.validate_timestamps=0`).
 *
 * The first request hitting MediaWiki triggers caching of `LocalSettings.php`
 * and subsequent changes to it (via `overrideLocalSettings()` will thus not
 * been taken in account since PHP serves it from the stalled cache (as
 * intended).
 *
 * The issue notably happens when running tests in parallel, some test suites
 * might not alter the `LocalSettings.php`, the stock one is thus cached and
 * when another tests changes the file, the new settings are now taken in
 * account on any test relying on the change ends up failing.
 *
 * We hit that case for the API Testing suite and Selenium:
 * https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T276428#7194025
 *
 * The PHP-Fpm opcache is held in shared memory and we thus can not clear it
 * using `opcache_reset()` from the PHP CLI. However the opcache is cleared
 * when reloading PHP-Fpm https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T418369#11703410

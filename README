PageTriage is an extension for MediaWiki. It implements an interface for reviewing, categorizing,
and sometimes deleting new pages. It is designed with the New Pages Patroller in mind, and replaces
Special:NewPages and the patrolled edits feature.

It is very focused on the Wikipedia article creation workflow, though it could probably be adapted
for use on other wikis.

The PageTriage software is licensed under the MIT license (see COPYING file).

The reference template implementation is at NewPagesFeed_Templates.xml.  This was imported from
English Wikipedia and is licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0 (CC-BY-SA-3.0.txt).

/**
 * Handles the queue for asynchronous calls after actions
 * are made and before the page refreshes
 *
 * When the queue is available, gadgets and external code
 * can interact with it and add methods that will be invoked
 * for specific actions:
 * - `mw.pageTriage.actionQueue.add( action, function )`
 *    Adds a function to the queue for the action.
 * - `mw.pageTriage.actionQueue.peek( action )`
 *   See the current queue and the functions that are attached
 *   to the given action. This is meant mostly for testing,
 *   debugging, and validation.
 *
 * Internally inside PageTriage, the queue is invoked, per action:
 * - `mw.pageTriage.actionQueue.run( action, data )`
 *   Run all the functions attached to this action.
 *   This method allows for three functionalities:
 *   - #run( 'action', data )
 *     If action is a string, the specific action will be invoked
 *     and all attached functions will receive the data that is given
 *     in the 'data' parameter.
 *   - #run( [ 'action1', 'action2' ], data )
 *     If action is an array, then all provided actions will be invoked
 *     and all attached functions will receive the data that is given
 *     in the 'data' parameter.
 *   - #run( { action1: { ...}, action2: { ... } }, data )
 *     If action is an object, it is expected as a key/value pair where
 *     the keys are the actions to invoke, and the value per action is the
 *     extra data, per action, that should be sent to the functions.
 *     In this case, all given actions in the keyed object will be invoked
 *     and the associated functions will be sent a combined data of the
 *     data parameter as well as the specific action-date that's given
 *     in the object.
 * - `mw.pageTriage.actionQueue.runAndRefresh( action, data )`
 *   Run all the functions attached to this action and when all of
 *   them are done (resolved or rejected) continue to refresh
 *   the page.
 * Both of the above methods return a promise that resolves when
 * all functions have finished running.
